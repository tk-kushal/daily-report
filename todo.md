make the theme more standard and appealing

~implement a light theme~

~add a custom light and dark theme button~

~fix the month date loading issue~

add more font options for the text box

add a full-screen type of thing for the report, and maybe rethink the UI.

and yes, please make it a PWA as soon as possible.

~Fixing the data fetching issue~

make and add a logo for the application and find a way to convert it into a PWA

can add color theme options by adjusting the hue of the background using filter

Need to find a pwa generator website or use the pwa generator NPM package to generate the assets for the manifest file.

add a dedicated notes section and a analysis page

change the architecture to use a different document for current editable copy and only append the day's data to the month bundle on the next day, this is to avoid any accidental overwrite like today.
